## 0. Setup

Load packages.

```{r packages, warning = FALSE, message= FALSE}
library(MASS)
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(caret) 
library(plotly)
```

### Bagging

Load Boston data.
```{r boston}
boston_df <- as_tibble(Boston)

# Summary view of data
boston_df[1:10, ]
summary(boston_df)
```

Split data into a train and test set.
```{r split}
set.seed(12)
split <- initial_split(boston_df, prop = 0.8)
boston_train <- training(split)
boston_test <- testing(split)

# Specify recipe for pre-processing data and prep train and test datasets using this recipe.
rec <- boston_train %>%
  recipe( ~ .) 

prepped <- rec %>%
  prep(retain = TRUE)
  
train <- prepped %>% 
  juice()

test <- prepped %>% 
  bake(new_data = boston_test)
```

Fit bagging model with default values for trees = 500 (the number of trees in the ensemble) and min_n (the minimum number of data points in a node for it to be split further).
```{r bagging_default}
# Fit tree model to training set
rf_mod <- rand_forest(mode = "regression", mtry = 13) %>%
  set_engine("randomForest") %>%
  fit(medv ~ ., data = train)

rf_mod

# Variable importance
rf_mod$fit$importance %>%
  as_tibble(rownames = "variable") %>%
  arrange(-IncNodePurity) %>%
  ggplot(aes(fct_reorder(variable, IncNodePurity, .desc = TRUE), IncNodePurity)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")

# Evaluate tree performance on test set
test <- test %>%
  bind_cols(predict(rf_mod, new_data = test)) %>%
  rename(bag_pred = ".pred")

# rmse
test %>% 
  rmse(truth = medv, estimate = bag_pred)

# Scatter plot estimate vs actual
test %>%
  ggplot(aes(medv, bag_pred)) +
  geom_point()
```

Fit bagging  models for a grid of different values for trees and min_n. The test rmse does not vary much for different numbers of trees in the ensemble, provided the number of trees is reasoably large - the chart suggests above 300 makes little difference.  The test rmse is slightly smaller for smaller values of min_n, the minimum number of data points in a node that are required for the node to be split further. In other words, having more complex trees gives slightly smaller rmse.
```{r bagging_vary}
# Setup grid of values to fit models to training data for.
bag_grid <- grid_regular(
  trees %>% range_set(c(10,  3000)), 
  min_n %>% range_set(c(5,  80)), 
  levels = 10
)

# Helper function to fit model to train data and calculate rmse on test dataset.
fit_rf <- function(rf_mod){
  rf_mod <- rf_mod %>%
  set_engine("randomForest") %>%
  fit(medv ~ ., data = train)

  test %>%
  bind_cols(predict(rf_mod, new_data = test)) %>%
  rmse(truth = medv, estimate = ".pred") %>%
  rename(est = ".estimate") %>%
  dplyr::select(est) %>%
  unlist()
}

# Fit model for each combination of the grid values.
bag_grid <- bag_grid %>%
  mutate(rf_mod = map2(trees, min_n, ~rand_forest(mode = "regression", mtry = 13, trees = .x, min_n = .y)),
         rmse = map_dbl(rf_mod, fit_rf))

# Plot rmse for each value of trees and min_n
bag_grid %>%
  mutate(trees = as_factor(as.character(trees))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(min_n, rmse, colour = trees)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line()
```

### Random forests

Now investigate random forests, ie values of mtry other than 13 (the number of variables).  Bagging is the case where mtry = 13, the same as the number of variables in the model. A default choice for mtry is p/3 for regression problems.  In this case p =13, so 4 is the default.  Look at mtry = 2, 4, 8, 10, 13.  Use min_n = 20 and trees = 1000.

The test rmse flattens out and is at a minimum for mtry = 13, which is just the bagging model.  This suggests that random forests do not provide an improvement over bagging models for this dataset.

```{r random_forests}
# Setup grid of values to fit models to training data for.
rf_mtry <- tibble("mtry" = c(2, 4, 8, 10, 13))

# Fit random forest model for each value of mtry.
rf_mtry <- rf_mtry %>%
  mutate(rf_mod = purrr::map(mtry, ~rand_forest(mode = "regression", mtry = .x, trees = 1000, min_n = 20)),
         rmse = map_dbl(rf_mod, fit_rf))

# Plot rmse for each value of trees and min_n
rf_mtry %>%
  ggplot(aes(mtry, rmse)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line()
```

### Boosting

Fit a model and tune the hyperparameters using the train function from the Caret package. The test rmse of this model was actually slightly worse than the bagging model.

```{r boosting}
# Specify the process to select the hyperparameters
fitControl <-
  trainControl(method = "repeatedcv",
               number = 10,
               repeats = 10)

gbmGrid <- expand.grid(
  interaction.depth = c(1, 5, 9),
  n.trees = c(50, 200, 400),
  shrinkage = 0.1,
  n.minobsinnode = 20
)

# Fit boosting model using 'train'
boost_mod <-
  train(
    medv ~ . ,
    data = train,
    method = "gbm",
    trControl = fitControl,
    verbose = FALSE,
    tuneGrid = gbmGrid
  )

boost_mod

# Evaluate model performance on the test set
test$boost_pred = predict(boost_mod, newdata = test)

rmse(test, truth = medv, estimate = "boost_pred") 

test %>%
  ggplot(aes(medv, boost_pred)) +
  geom_point()

```
